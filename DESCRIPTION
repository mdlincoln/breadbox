Description: In the vein of "20 Questions", this package helps visualize 
    difficult-to-grasp number like area, large distances, or even large 
    timescales, by producing label sets that reference real things such as 
    dates of historical events, heights of well-knoen buildings, or sizes of 
    famous masterworks of art.
